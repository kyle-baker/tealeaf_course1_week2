1) Name what each of the below is

a = 1 
# local variable, Fixnum object value of 1

@a = 2 
# instance variable, Fixnum object value 2

user = User.new 
# instantiating a new object in the User class and assigning to variable user

user.name 
#calling the getter method for the '@name' instance variable of the user class

2) 
  module ExampleModule
  end

  class ExampleClass
    include ExampleModule
   end

3) Class variables begin with two @@ symbols, shared among the class and all of its descendants. Instnace variable is not shared by class descendants, and begins with one @ symbol.

4) attr_accessor creates a getter and setter method for an instance variable

5) calling the 'some_method' method from the Dog class

6) Subclassing - One class inherits from another. Dog subclass will inherit all behaviors of Animal superclass. (is-a)
   Mixing - When certain behaviors are shared among classes, but not every single one of them. Multiple inheritances.   (has-a)

7. def initialize(name)
    @name = name
    end

8. Yes

9. Debugging. Can use rubygem pry, and insert a binding.pry line of code to stop a program from executing on a certain line. From there,
can test various variables and methods to help locate error.
